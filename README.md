# Yaw Control Model
All code files for my science research project titled "Using Yaw Control to Collectively Optimize Wind Farm Energy Production."
- The inputs folder contains all of the wind data and location data used for the project.
- The output folder contains all of the graphs and data generated by the yaw control model.
- The utilities folder contains all of the programs used to clean up and format data for the yaw control model to use.
- Finally, the root folder contains the yaw control models themselves.
